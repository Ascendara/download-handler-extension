> With the Ascendara Download Blocker you can easily block all downloads from starting, and get a window showing the direct download URL. This Chrome extension is used mainly to obtain links faster to copy and paste into Ascendara.

## Download Ascendara right now! https://ascendara.app/

# How to install the extension
Since I haven't published the extension to the Chrome extension store, you need to manually download and set it up. Once this project gets more attention I will upload it.
1. Download the repo files by clicking on ```Code``` then ```Download ZIP```
2. Unzip the files into a directory
3. In your browser (I recommend [Arc]() to block all the ads and popups) go to the ```Manage Extensions``` tab
4. Enable ```Developer mode```
5. Click on ```Load Unpacked```
6. Select the files you just downloaded
7. 
# How to use the extension
1. Pin the extension for ease-of-use
2. Before you start a download, enable the blocker
3. Copy the DDL into Ascendara to start downloading your game
