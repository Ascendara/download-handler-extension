> The Ascendara Download Handler is a browser extension that sends downloads from known (or added) provider straight to Ascendara. Download games 50% faster just by enabling the extension! Never worry about having to turn it off or on manually, the extension detects when a download starts and sends it to Ascendara.

## Download Ascendara right now! https://ascendara.app/

# How to install the extension
This is a step by step on how to download and load the extension in developer mode. I recommend that you add it to your browser [here]().
1. Download the repo files by clicking on ```Code``` then ```Download ZIP```
2. Unzip the files into a directory
3. In your browser (I recommend [Arc](https://arc.net/download) to block all the ads and popups) go to the ```Manage Extensions``` tab
4. Enable ```Developer mode```
5. Click on ```Load Unpacked```
6. Select the files you just downloaded
7. Enable the extension

# How to use the extension
1. Once you installed the extension, enable it
2. When a download starts you will get a prompt asking to open Ascendara
3. Toggle the box that always opens the application
4. Click on the button that says "open in Ascendara"
